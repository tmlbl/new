`new` is a templating framework for creating re-usable project templates. You
might use `new` if you want to:

- Show users how to set up your framework or library with an example project
- Distribute library, component, or service boilerplate to your organization
- Help your students set up dependencies for their assignments

Templates consist of a directory containing files using Go template syntax and a 
definition in a `template.yaml` file. You can run `new template` to create a new
template project.
